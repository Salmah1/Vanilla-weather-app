### Description 


This is a weather application interface. It includes a search form for inputting a city name, an overview section for displaying basic weather information, a temperature section for displaying current temperature and unit options, and a weather-forecast section for displaying a 5-day forecast. 

The app is built with Bootstrap 5 and uses the Axios library to make API requests for weather data.
